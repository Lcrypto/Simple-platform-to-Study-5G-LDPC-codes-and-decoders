# Simple-platform-to-Study-5G-LDPC-codes-and-decoders
The GitHub repository contains a simple platform for studying 5G Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes and decoders. It includes MATLAB implementations and MEX files for fast decoding based on a rewritten fork from https://github.com/SherlockHsu/5G-LDPC-MexFunction.

The main file in the repository is "Main_ldpc.m". Additionally, there is a "mex Function" folder that includes a "build.m" script to build the MEX file for the decoders.
